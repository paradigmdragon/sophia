# Final Implementation Directive: Sophia v0.1

## 1. Project Identity: The Positive Companion
This directive confirms the shift of Sophia's identity from a passive recorder to an active "Growing Local Companion" based on the **Bicameral Resonance (Left/Right Brain)** architecture.

## 2. Core Philosophy
- **No Negatives:** All constraints are reframed as positive guidelines.
- **Resonance:** Intelligence emerges from the link between Structural Truth (Server/Right Brain) and User Context (Local/Left Brain).
- **Growth Trigger:** Questions arise not from "errors" but from "opportunities for deeper understanding".

## 3. Implementation Checklist
- [x] **Constitution:** `Docs/Sophia.md` rewritten to define the Bicameral Resonance model.
- [x] **Engine Specs:** `Docs/Epidora.md` created to define the 6 Structural Alignment Coordinates (EPI-01~06) positively.
- [x] **Memory Model:** `Docs/EPISODE.md` updated to include the "Meaning of Choice" (Possibility -> Realization).
- [ ] **Code Implementation:** Future implementation must strictly adhere to the "Positive Alignment" principles defined in these documents.

## 4. Next Steps
- Implement the "Bicameral Resonance" logic in the core engine.
- Develop the "Structural Alignment" questions based on `Docs/Epidora.md`.
- Ensure all UI/UX copy reflects the "Helper/Inquirer" persona.
